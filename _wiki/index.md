Cirrusboard is a minimal and lightweight hobbyist forum software written in PHP. Implementing the core functionality you'd want from a forum, it's perfect for small to medium sized forums and runs lightning fast on anything from dedicated hardware to the tiniest of VPSes.

It was originally written to support the [Voxelmanip Forums](https://forum.voxelmanip.se), but is also a general purpose forum software that can be installed and customised to your forum's branding.

It is inspired by the Acmlmboard family of forum software, reimplementing various features of Acmlmboard-style forums such as post layouts, while improving upon code quality and security.
