Cirrusboard has the following user ranks:

- `-1`: Banned
-  `0`: Guest (internal)
-  `1`: Member
-  `2`: Moderator
-  `3`: Administrator
-  `4`: Root Administrator

Most of the forum software's functionality checks for a hardcoded appropriate user rank. You can also configure certain permissions on a per-forum basis, see [the forum permission system](Forum_Permission_System).
